Discord.js Bot Template
=================

**~ How to use ~**

----------

Go here and create a new app: [Discord Apps](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/)

(Make sure you enable the bot for it)

Copy its token and paste it in the `.env` file, like this:

```TOKEN="YOUR_TOKEN_VALUE" //Quotes are required```

----------

Copy your bot's Client ID

Replace YOUR_CLIENT_ID with your actual Client ID in this link, to get an invite link for the bot:

https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&scope=bot&permissions=0

----------

Discord -> Settings -> Appearance -> Enable "Developer Mode"

Right-click on your bot (in Discord) and click "Copy ID"

Paste that line
